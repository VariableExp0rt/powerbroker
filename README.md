A side project exploring Crossplane controllers (the universal control plane). Aims to implement an example permissions data model as XR's, reconciled in graph database as "nodes" and "relationships"."

This project was started to;

- [x] Explore how Crossplane resolves references
- [x] Research the managed resource, composites and claims model
- [x] A reason to get started with `kapitan` which can be found [here](https://kapitan.dev/)
- [x] A deeper understanding of Kubernetes controllers
